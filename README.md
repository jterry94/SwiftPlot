# SwiftPlot
This program uses the CorePlot framework to plot exp(-x) on the Mac and on the iPad. We build two programs in this class using Swift. The first one is a Mac only application. The second program runs on both the iPad and on the Mac. The second program utilizes the Catalyst environment. The Catalyst environment is the result of the infamous Project Marzipan at Apple. The Catalyst environment is designed to make it easier to port iPad apps to the Mac. Hopefully at some point in the future, Apple decides to release a 2D and 3D plotting library for Swift. Until then we have to rely on third party frameworks.

You must use the CorePlot library with this code. CorePlot is available at: https://github.com/core-plot/core-plot
